# Customer_Prediction_using_CreditData
German Credit Data Predictor

The aim of the project is to analyse the German Credit data set and create a predictive model based on supervised learning. The model is used to help the bankers find out whether a customer is good or bad so that, the decision on giving a loan or not can be taken.There are two types of risks associated with wrong decisions- -Predicting a good customer bad and not approving a loan could cause business loss to the bank. -Predicting a bad customer good and approving a loan could cause financial loss to the bank.
